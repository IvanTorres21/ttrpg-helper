# ttrpg-helper
Just an easy way for me to manage my ttrpg campaigns music and background 

Start the server with <b>npm start</b>, it will use port 3000.

When adding new songs and pictures you have to modify the jsons following the templates they already have and adding said files to a folder in: "www/assets/images" and "www/assets/music". 

It's not either a pretty nor efficent app, but it is exactly what i needed.
